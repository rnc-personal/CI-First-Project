# PROJECT 1 - HTML & CSS - EARS: ENHANCED AUDIO RESEARCH SOLUTIONS 
 
EARS (ENHANCED AUDIO RESEARCH SOLUTIONS) is the World's leading manufacturer of headphones and wanted to attract new customers with a new, less formal design than their old website
They wanted a site that focused on showing off their previous work with strong photography as well as providing lots of information for prospective clients in a less formal, stuffy way than their previous website did. The site aims to show off their work through both photography, technical case studies as well as personal studies from their past customers. The site will also have some pricing information and a contact form to serve as a lead generator / brochure site for the sales team.

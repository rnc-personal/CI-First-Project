24/09/2022 - Bug after adding FontAwesome where changes to CSS didn't register, only HTML changes were being picked up.
Removed Font Awesome but no change. Tried Re-order stylesheet links order in header but again no change..
Had to Rename CSS file and re-link. Confirmed there were no typos/missing characters in the css link. (Resolved)

- Issue with case studies grid with text overflow because of the width of the grid items.(Resolved)



- Gallery Hover Overlay on mobile was a challenge. Tried tip from:
https://time2hack.com/can-i-use-hover-on-touch-devices/ but not widely support so instead set a fixed opacity on the overlay for mobile.

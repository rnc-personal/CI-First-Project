Card Overlay Idea inspired by: https://stevenstromick.com/css/css-card-overlay/

Responsive iframe tip for YT Video from: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_responsive_iframes.asp

24/09/2022 - Bug after adding FontAwesome where changes to CSS didn't register, only HTML changes were being picked up.
Removed FA but no change. Tried Re-order stylesheet links order in header but again no change..
Had to Rename CSS file and re-link. Confirmed there were no typos/missing characters in the css link.

- Issue with case studies grid with text overflow because of the idth of the grid items.(Resolved)



- Gallery Hover Overlay on mobile was a challenge. Tried tip from:
https://time2hack.com/can-i-use-hover-on-touch-devices/ but not widely support so instead seta fixed opacity on the overlay for mobile.

**************STILL TO DO**************

- Look into Home gallery, card heights being different from images feels strange.

- Contact Page Footer Subscribe Form is trying to validate the main conact form. names/ids are different...Is it just because those fields are required?

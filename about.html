                    <h2>EARS speakers have been voted best audio manufacturer every year since 2006. Although they've
                        won the title more than any other company, they're still humble to the fact that their customers
                        are the best part of their business. As one happy customer said, "They make the best speakers
                        I've ever heard! They blow away the competition and I'm so glad I bought them."</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Of all the companies in the audio industry, EARS is certainly one of the most popular. Known for
                        their excellent customer service, EARS has been making fans out of even the most discerning
                        listeners. From the moment a customer calls to place an order, they are greeted with a friendly
                        and courteous staff who go out of their way to make sure that they are getting exactly what they
                        need. EARS is especially known for their ability to listen and accommodate customers' needs,
                        even when they seem unreasonable. When one customer insisted on a flashy new skin color for his
                        new headphones, EARS promptly designed and shipped them a set in his favorite color—one that had
                        never been done before. When another called in saying that he liked the sound of his headphones
                        so
                        much, he wanted to be able to enjoy them without having to plug them in, EARS created an elegant
                        pair of battery-powered headphones that would run off a single Li-on battery. "It was really
                        exciting," said Oren Westover, CEO of EARS. "We get a lot of requests like that."

                        When asked about their secret for such great customer service and high-quality products,
                        Westover was quick to credit their employees: "I can't say enough about our team. They're</p>

                            <p>I've really been getting a lot of enjoyment out of the headphones that EARS made for us,
                                and I can't recommend them highly enough. The pair that they created was exactly what we
                                were looking for: very comfortable, fit perfectly with my lifestyle, and provided the
                                right sound quality in all situations.</p>

                            <p>The designers at EARS really know their stuff too; when we went over our options, they
                                helped us pick the perfect pair for my lifestyle. For example, We wanted something that
                                would work for day-to-day use at work as well as exercising outside or just listening in
                                bed before falling asleep. They took note of everything I said and made sure it was
                                reflected in the final product (and even threw in some additional features!)</p>

                            <p>We recorded our first project with EARS' equipment, edited it together quickly and
                                efficiently, and got it released in time for its premiere at Cannes Film Festival. Our
                                success wasn't a fluke; when we took on our next project, again using only EARS'
                                equipment, we were able to complete it even faster than our first film. </p>
                            <p>Since then, we've been back again and again. With each new film project Lars and I take
                                on, we rely more and more on EARS' excellent products for the best possible results.</p>

                            <p>I recently had the pleasure of working with a company called EARS ™ on a project to
                                improve the sound quality of noise-cancelling headphones. I have always been incredibly
                                hard to please when it comes to headphones: I love music, but my job involves a lot of
                                travel and I have to have something that will drown out the sounds of airplane engines,
                                screaming kids, and crying babies. So I'm willing to spend money on good headphones—but
                                I expect them to be as much functional as they are stylish.</p>

                            <p>My first impression was that they were genuinely nice people who wanted nothing more than
                                to make sure their customers were happy with the product they were selling. They took
                                measurements of my ears and had me try on an assortment of different sizes until we
                                found just the right one that fit snugly but comfortably.</p>
                            <p>Usually when you buy something from a company for the first time, you're a little nervous
                                about what the service will be like after you've made your purchase. Will there be
                                issues? Will the product work? Will it hold up over time? But from my first experience
                                with EARS, I can tell you that you don't need to worry about any of that.</p>

                            <p>EARS has been my favorite manufacturer of headphones for a while now. They make the
                                highest quality headphones on the market, which I can tell by how light they are and how
                                rich the sound is.</p>
                            <p>My first pair of EARS came from an airport store when I was on
                                vacation in Australia a few years ago. They were so good that I bought another pair
                                online when mine broke.</p>
